### Projects in NLP,Data Science, Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Machine Learning 

#### Sentiment Analysis of IMDB Reviews
Sentiment analysis automates the classification of text into positive or negative emotions. In this project, I fine-tuned a BERT model using PyTorch to analyze IMDb movie reviews, achieving 94% accuracy. This model helps viewers make informed decisions and provides filmmakers with insights to improve their work and marketing strategies. Leveraging NLP and machine learning, it effectively utilizes audience sentiment for better decision-making.

#### Customer churn Prediction
With the advancement of technology and a highly competitive market, customers are more likely to switch telecom operators for better offers, leading to significant business losses. Research shows that controlling 5% of customer churn can increase profits by 25-85%. This project predicts churn using a Random Forest model, focusing on minimizing Type II error and addressing class imbalance with the SMOTEENN technique. Accurate predictions optimize retention strategies, reduce costs, and improve profitability.

#### Spatiotemporal Analysis of LA Crimes
In this project, I used Tableau and Python with K-means clustering and dimension reduction techniques to analyze and gain insights into crime patterns in Los Angeles. The data, collected from the LAPD over three years, was visualized and explored to identify trends and clusters, providing a deeper understanding of crime distribution and dynamics in the area.
